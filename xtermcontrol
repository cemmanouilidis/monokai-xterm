# Each line in the file is either a comment or contains an attribute.
# Attributes consist of a keyword and an associated value:

#
# Whitespace is ignored in attributes unless within a quoted value. The
# character '#' is taken to begin a comment. Each '#' and all remaining
# characters on that line is ignored.
